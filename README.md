# udacity-deep-learning nano Degree Project
## I will be utilizing this repo to log my progress for my Udacity Deep Learning course, along with exercises.
#### Work in progress will be stored into the develop branch while it is polished, once ready it will be merged into the master branch.

* I will be pushing Python source files (.py) along with Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) in order to enhance the presentation of the material.
  * To view the Jupyter Notebooks in this github simply click on the `filename`.ipynb file in the repostiory and it will load.
